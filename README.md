# current-slideshow-item
An OBS script that updates the selected text source with the file name of the currently shown image in the selected image slide show source.

## Requirements
Requires OBS 29.0 (gives image slide show source the required functionality)
Requires Python 3 (to be safe, use 3.6 and above)

## Usage
1. Open Tools > Scripts in OBS
2. Go to the Python Settings and verify that Python is loaded. If not, select the Python installation path
3. Add current_slideshow_item.py in the Scripts tab.
4. On the side panel, select the image slide show source and the text source.
